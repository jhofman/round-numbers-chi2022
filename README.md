This repository contains the dataset, data analysis code, as well as the back-end and front-end code for the number rounding service associated with the paper [Round Numbers Can Sharpen Cognition](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501852), published at [CHI'2022](https://chi2022.acm.org/).

For the study data and analyses, see the `data` directory and `.ipynb` notebook files (or `.html` files for read-only codes and outputs).

For the prototype nunber rounding service, see setup instructions in the `azure-function` and `chrome-extension` directories. We have already included a functional back-end endpoint so if you only want to try out the service, simply load the `chrome-extension` directory into a Chromium-based browser's extension management, e.g., [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
